# CSGO Utilities
A script to handle auto gun drops amongst other things

## Installation
1. Download Python: `https://www.python.org/downloads/` 
2. Edit `main.py` to change logLocation to your CSGO installation path. 
Example: `D:\Games\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo`

## Usage
1. Enter `con_logfile "console.log"` into the CSGO console each time or into your autoexec config. (Restart CSGO if it is running)
2. Run the `start.bat` file each time you need to. (Pin to taskbar for easy access)

## Notes
This requires you to be tabbed into the game.

You should probably delete the console.log file occasionally as it can get to a large size.
