# csgo-afk-controller
A script to handle auto gun drops amongst other things

## Installation
1. Install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Double click to run the .py file

## Usage
1. Enter this command `con_logfile "console.log"` into either your console each time or into autoexec. 
2. Edit the logLocation variable to match your current csgo installation directory. (Right click the .py file -> Edit with idle)
Example = `D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\console.log"`
3. When you need to be afk, run the script and open the console in game. (Must be tabbed into the game)

## Notes
You should probably delete the console.log file occasionally as it can get to a large size.
